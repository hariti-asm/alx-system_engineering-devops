**Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident**

**Issue Summary:**
- **Duration:** 
  - Start Time: November 15, 2023, 03:45 AM UTC
  - End Time: November 15, 2023, 06:20 AM UTC
- **Impact:**
  - The outage affected our primary web service, causing intermittent connectivity issues for approximately 30% of our users. Users experienced slow response times and, in some cases, were unable to access the service during the incident.

**Timeline:**
- **Detection:**
  - November 15, 2023, 03:45 AM UTC: The issue was detected through automated monitoring alerts indicating a spike in error rates and latency.
- **Actions Taken:**
  - Investigation began by examining server logs and network traffic patterns to identify potential issues.
  - Initially, focus was on recent code deployments, but no anomalies were found.
  - Assumptions leaned towards a DDoS attack or database overload, prompting a thorough examination of network security and database performance.
  - Escalated incident to the infrastructure and security teams.

**Misleading Investigation Paths:**
- Investigated potential DDoS attack without concrete evidence, leading to wasted time and resources.
- Considered database overload as a likely cause, although database performance metrics indicated normal behavior.

**Escalation:**
- The incident was escalated to the infrastructure and security teams within the first 30 minutes to expedite resolution.

**Resolution:**
- Identified that a recent configuration change in the load balancer settings inadvertently caused improper distribution of traffic, leading to service degradation.
- Restored normal functionality by rolling back the load balancer configuration to the last known stable state.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
- **Root Cause:**
  - The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings resulted in uneven distribution of traffic, causing increased load on specific servers and subsequent degradation in service performance.
- **Resolution:**
  - Rolled back the load balancer configuration to the previous stable state.
  - Implemented automated checks to alert on load balancer configuration changes.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Conduct a thorough review of the change management process to prevent configuration errors.
  - Enhance monitoring for load balancer metrics to quickly identify deviations.
  - Implement regular load testing scenarios to validate the resilience of the web service under varying loads.
- **Tasks:**
  - Conduct a post-incident review with involved teams to share lessons learned and improve incident response.
  - Update documentation for load balancer configuration to include best practices and potential pitfalls.
  - Schedule regular training sessions for operations and development teams on incident response procedures.:
