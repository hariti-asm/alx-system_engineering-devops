What Happens When You Type https://www.google.com and Press Enter?
DNS Request:

The process begins with a DNS (Domain Name System) request. The browser checks its local cache for the IP address of www.google.com.
If not found, it queries a DNS server to resolve the domain name into an IP address.
TCP/IP:

Once the IP address is obtained, a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection is established to the server using the IP address and port number 443 for HTTPS.
Firewall:

The connection passes through any firewalls, which may be configured to allow or block specific types of traffic.
HTTPS/SSL:

For secure communication, the browser and server initiate an SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) handshake. This involves exchanging cryptographic information to establish a secure connection.
Load-Balancer:

Many high-traffic websites use load balancers to distribute incoming requests across multiple servers to ensure optimal resource utilization and prevent overloading a single server.
Web Server:

The request reaches a web server. The server processes the request, which might involve fetching static content or forwarding dynamic requests to an application server.
Application Server:

If the request requires dynamic content, it is sent to an application server. This server processes the request, which may involve interacting with databases or other services.
Database:

If data retrieval or manipulation is needed, the application server communicates with a database server to perform the necessary operations.
Response:

The web server, application server, or database server generates a response.
The response travels back through the same path (load balancer, SSL, TCP/IP) to the browser.
Rendering:

The browser receives the response, which includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The browser renders the page, executing scripts and applying styles to display the content.
User Interaction:
The user can interact with the page, triggering additional requests for resources.
